# 🚀 Welcome to the **@SvicHQ** GitHub Organization

Hey! Whether you’re deep into development or just like to poke around with code, you’re in the right place.  
This is where we stash all sorts of open-source experiments — **Telegram bots**, **PlayStation jailbreak tools**, random **automation scripts**, and anything else we felt like putting together.

We like getting our hands dirty. Learning by doing.  
Seeing what **Python** and **JavaScript** can actually do when you push them a little.

## 💡 What We Believe

> **Code’s just better when people share it.**  

We’re here to build stuff, learn from each other, and keep open source actually *open*.  
If you like experimenting and building things people actually use, you’ll fit right in.
